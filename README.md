# picoCTF-writeups

The purpose of this repository is to document and present my solutions to different picoCTF challenges. I will attempt all challenges in all categories and present the solutions in these writeups written in markdown.

### Noteworthy information
The majority of these challenges will be solved using kali linux 2023.2 which I have running on the VMware Workstation 17 Player.
