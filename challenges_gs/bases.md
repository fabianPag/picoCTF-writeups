# Challenge: Bases - 100p

## Description
What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

## Process
The seemingly random string is actually Base64 encoded. I found a website that could decode Base64. Pasting the string there gave me the string *l3arn_th3_r0p35*. Providing the flag picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35} gave the correct solution.
