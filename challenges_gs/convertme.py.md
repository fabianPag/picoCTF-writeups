## Process
Upon running the file using ``python3 convertme.py`` you get asked *If 72 is in decimal base, what is it in binary base?*. Converting decimal 72 to binary can either be done by hand or through an online converter. I chose to do it through an online converter which gave me 1001000. Answering this question outputs the flag.
