# Challenge: First Grep - 100p

## Description
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

## Process
Simply running the file will give a large string output. To efficiently find the flag, I ran ``grep "picoCTF" ./file``. Doing this, will output the flag.
