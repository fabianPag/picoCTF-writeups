# Challenge: Obedient Cat - 5p

## Description
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). Download flag.

## Process
This challenge is pretty straightforward. In the challenge description, *"Download flag"* is a link. Click it and open the file in your favorite text-editor to reveal the flag. I chose Visual Studio Code.
